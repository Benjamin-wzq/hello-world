just a new try

2019.3.10
i started to learn some computer knowledge,because maybe it can work when i was writing my master's thesis.
my professional emphasis at civil engieering is computer vision while it should not belong here.
now i confess i have some interests but i need to learn a lot of new knowledges.
i mad up mt mind,i will try.
